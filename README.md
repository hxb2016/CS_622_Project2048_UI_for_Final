#  CS_622_Project_2048Game



This project concerns a Number Game 2048. It uses Swing modules to create the interface. To play this
game, you can choose to create an account or just start as guest. If you register account, you can see your last result and best result when you play
the game next time. In order to complete the function, I will save user data Map into a file (Data.dat in package userdata).
When you create an account, you need set a user name and a password (the two option is must). The game blocks Array size is 4x4. When there is a number that is larger than 2048 (*In order to save time for test, I change the win number from 2048 to 16 in this
version. This means that if any number is equal to 16, you will the game*), you win in the game. When the interface is fully filled with number and there is no number that is bigger than 2048, you fail in the game. After ending, you will see you taken time and set your last record to record pane.  In this version, I add profile panel and changing profile information function.
